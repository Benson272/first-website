Terminology
tags- things inside <>; tags almost always come in pairs (<html> and </html>)
head- contains info about HTML file (title; title is what we see in the tab)
body- contains content such as text, images, and links (content in body is what is visible on an actual page)
<p>- are used to indicate paragraphs
<h1>- is a heading tag; content in this tag will be the biggest; this can go all the way to <h6> (the higher the number the smaller the font size)
hyperlink- link that is clicked to send user to a different page
<a href="link"> "thing to click" </a>- This format is for adding a hyperlink
<img src="link of picture" />- used to add picture to page (no closing tag)
<ol>- used to create an ordered list
	<li>-used to show list
<ul>- used to make an unordered list (bullet points)
<!--comment-->- used to make a comment in the code
<strong>- bold a word
<em>- italicize a word
<table (border=1px)>- used to create an organized table
	<tr>- used to specify rows
	<td>- table data; what will be displayed (more td= more column)
	<tbody>- same as body for html
	<thead>- same as head for html
<div>- lets you divide the page into portions
<span>- lets you individually style single word
psuedo-class selector- :hover , :first-child , :nth-child(2/3/4/...) , :visited

To connect to a CSS file use <link>, <link> needs 3 attributes: A type = "text/css" A rel = "stylesheet" A href = name of CSS
To create unique ids for div use <div id="name of id">; to change it in css use "*name of id"
in CSS file selector:hover can change the appearance of the word when our mouse hovers over it
display has 4 prop.: block (makes the element take up the full width of the page) 
		     inline-block (makes the element a block, but other elements can sit next to it)
		     inline (only takes up as much width as it needs to)
		     none (makes the element and its content disappear)
position- absolute
	  fixed - it will always be on your screen
          relative
